# Non-visual Activity tracking
This project is about using machine learning to predict user activity.
A set of activities was categories and collected using accelerometer for training purpose.
The dataset was preprocessed with some filter such as kalman-flter to reduce the data noise.
Gaussian Naive Bayes was the best fit in terms of accuracy and inference speed after apply and compare with other algorithm, such as decision tree, svm, nnb.
